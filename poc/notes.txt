Time Series Forecasting comes under quantitative forecasting.

Time Series Data Components:
    Level
    Trend
    Seasonality
    Cyclicity
    Noise

Handling NULL values:
    Mean/Median Imputation
    Last Observation Carried Formward
    Next Observation Carried Backward
    Linear Interpolation
    Seasonal Linear Interpolation

Outliers:
    Deteching Outliers
        Extreme Value analysis
        Using Boxplot
        Using Histogram
    Handling Outliers
        Replacing the value with Mean, Median or Mode
        Trimming that record
        Lower and Higher end-capping
        Zero Capping

Two Methods to Extract(Decmpose) Components from The Time Series Data
    Additive Seasonal Component : When Seasonality is not a function of level (difference b/w peak and trough reamin same).
    Multiplicative Seasonal Component : With the increase in yearly trend the delta of peak and trough is also changing.

Smoothing Technique:
    Clearing out random noise and eliminating outliers to see patterns & trends.
    Helps in studying all the components independently.
    Can be achived using one of the Technique:
        Naive Method
        Simple Average Method
        Simple Moving Average
        Weighted Moving Average
            Simple Exponential Smoothing - It captures the Level of a Time Series.
                forecast for (t+1) is a function of current level component
            Holt's Exponential Smoothing - It captures both level and trend of a Time Series.
            
    To Evaluate the Forecast
        RMSE - Root Mean Squared Error
        MAPE - Mean Absolute Percentage Error


Stationary Series
    A series without a trend or seasonal components.
    A series whose mean, variance, covarience & standard deviation are not a function of time.
